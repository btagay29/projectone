#project overview

The premise of this project is to reflect an introductory understanding of how to utilize html and css styling to create webpages. The prompt and creative direction focuses on
showcasing who I am, my online and offline activitiies and interests. 

#technicaloverview

This project contains a total of 4 landing pages- an enclosing home page, an about me page, a moodboard page, and a music page. Each page includes navigation links to each other and 
a gif of a rotating letter B that also works as a navigation link. The navigation links were created through Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop. The content and texts were stylized and 
organized using css.
