	<h2> What's up- my name is Bryan Kurt Enriquez Tagay.
		I'm first-generation Filipino-American and many of us have long names. I'm also a gemini.
		I was born and raised in the Mission District of San Francisco where my vibrant and 
		multicultural upbringing contributes to who I am today.
		My passions include art, fashion, and community. In my free time I like going to the gym, 
		hanging out with friends, thrifting, eating good food, and exploring out to new places.</div>

	<h2>Besides going to SFSU for Visual Communication Design, 
		I'm also currently I’m a part-time barista in the city's downtown area. 
		One of my favorite parts of the job is making latte art. I’ve continued 
		to carry this affinity for working with my hands allowing my creativity to 
		manifest through tactile experiences. It's also been a great place 
		to stay incredibly caffeinated and to meet new people everyday.</h2>
